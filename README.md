# Advent of Code - All Submissions

## Outline

In years passed, I have mainly solved the Advent of Code problems in Python. I now plan to use the opportunity to learn other languages. 
With this in mind, I am going to slowly migrate my work from previous years here, into a `python` folder. 

## Goal for 2025

1. Learn Go
2. Learn Rust
3. Play with Mojo
4. Play with Zig
